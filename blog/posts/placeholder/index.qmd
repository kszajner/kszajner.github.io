<!-- TODO: Delete this directory and replace with real posts.
     Each post lives in its own subdirectory:
       blog/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/index.qmd

     Required front matter for a post:
       title: "..."
       date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
       description: "One-sentence summary shown in listing."
       categories: [people-analytics, causal-inference]  # optional

     After adding a post, run `quarto render` locally and commit the _freeze/ directory. -->
