## About

I'm a data scientist specialising in people analytics and workforce intelligence, currently
working in the banking industry in Gdańsk, Poland. My background spans econometrics, applied
statistics, and machine learning, with a focus on producing insights that hold up under
scrutiny — not just in a Jupyter notebook, but in front of a management board.

My differentiator: I care about **causality**, not just correlation. Knowing that two things
move together is rarely useful if you want to know whether an intervention will work.

**Background:** BSc/MSc in Informatics & Econometrics · 2 years as Data Analyst · ~1 year as Data Scientist
**Domain:** HR analytics · attrition modeling · compensation analysis · recruitment analytics
**Stack:** Python · R · SQL · PowerBI · Git
